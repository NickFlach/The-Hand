Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Product: The Hand
Version: v0.1 (Foundational)
Owner: Nick Flach
Status: Definition
1. Purpose

The Hand is a private, local-first ledger for recording work that matters.

Its purpose is to help individuals:

Maintain moral clarity about their actions

Reflect on real contribution (not activity)

Hold themselves accountable without performance or judgment

The Hand is not designed to motivate, gamify, or optimize behavior.
It exists to record truthfully and quietly.

2. Problem Statement

Modern tools incentivize:

Visibility over contribution

Output over impact

Engagement over responsibility

As a result, people lose track of:

What they actually built

Who they actually helped

What they actually learned through cost or correction

The Hand addresses this by providing:

A constrained structure for honest reflection

No social pressure

No reward mechanics

No extraction of attention or data

3. Target User
Primary User

Builders, engineers, operators, caregivers, artists

People who do real work that affects others

Individuals who value competence and care over recognition

Non-Target Users

Users seeking motivation, affirmation, or gamification

Influencer-driven or audience-driven behavior

Habit-tracking or productivity optimization users

4. Core Principles (Non-Negotiable)

Private by default

Local-first

No scoring, ranking, or streaks

No public feed

No behavioral nudging

User owns and can export all data

Silence is acceptable

Any feature that violates these principles is out of scope.

5. Core Use Case

A user opens The Hand after something meaningful has occurred and records it accurately.

The system does not prompt daily use.
It does not punish inactivity.
It does not praise activity.

6. Functional Requirements
6.1 Entry Types (Exactly Three)

Each entry must be one of:

Built

Created, repaired, improved, or completed something

Helped

Assisted, taught, supported, or carried responsibility for someone else

Learned

A correction, mistake, insight, or hard truth absorbed

No custom categories in v0.1.

6.2 Entry Structure (Required Fields)

Each entry includes:

Type: Built | Helped | Learned

Timestamp: Automatic, immutable

Affected: Who or what this impacted (free text)

Cost: What it cost the user (time, effort, discomfort, risk)

Reflection: What they would do differently next time

Constraints:

Each field limited to short text (2–3 sentences max)

No markdown

No rich media

6.3 Editing Rules

Entries editable for 24 hours

After 24 hours:

Original entry is locked

User may append an Addendum

Addendum is time-stamped separately

Purpose: preserve temporal honesty without punishment.

6.4 Viewing & Navigation

Chronological list (reverse order)

Filter by entry type

No summaries, scores, or trends by default

Optional (later):

Private pattern views (user-initiated only)

6.5 Sharing (Optional, Scarce)

Entry-level sharing only

User must:

Select a specific person or small group

State why they are sharing

No:

Public sharing

Discoverability

Re-sharing

7. Non-Functional Requirements
7.1 Data & Privacy

Local-first storage

Encrypted at rest

No default cloud sync

Explicit export (JSON + plain text)

The Hand should function fully offline.

7.2 Tone & UX Constraints

Neutral language only

No praise, encouragement, or judgment

No progress indicators

No urgency language (“keep going”, “don’t forget”)

If the system speaks, it must speak sparingly.

7.3 Accessibility

Keyboard navigable

Screen reader compatible

High contrast mode

Plain language reading level

8. Out of Scope (Explicit)

The following are not allowed in v0.1 or v1.0:

Social feeds

Likes, reactions, or comments

Gamification (streaks, badges, points)

AI-generated praise or feedback

Emotional analysis or sentiment scoring

Behavioral nudging

Ads or data monetization

9. Success Criteria (Qualitative)

The Hand is successful if users report:

Increased clarity about their real contributions

Reduced pressure to perform or document everything

Trust in the system’s restraint

Willingness to stop using it without penalty

If users feel compelled to check it daily, the product has failed.

10. Open Design Questions (Intentional)

These are deliberately unresolved:

Should long-term patterns be visible at all?

How much silence is too much silence?

When, if ever, should reflection prompts evolve?

These should be answered through careful use, not speculation.

11. One Sentence Definition (Canonical)

The Hand is a private ledger for recording what you built, who you helped, and what you learned—without performance or judgment.
