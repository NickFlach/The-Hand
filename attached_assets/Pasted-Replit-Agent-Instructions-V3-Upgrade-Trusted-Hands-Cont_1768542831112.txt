Replit Agent Instructions — V3 Upgrade (Trusted Hands)
Context

You are working on an existing React + Expo mobile app called The Hand.
V0, V1, and V2 are implemented and stable.

Your task is to implement V3: Trusted Hands.
This adds accountability without audience.

Do not redesign the app.
Do not expand scope beyond what is explicitly defined.

Non-Negotiable Constraints (Re-Assert)

These rules still apply absolutely:

No public feeds

No discovery

No likes, comments, or reactions

No threads or conversations

No notifications triggered by other people

No AI interpretation or summarization

No social metrics of any kind

If anything violates this, remove it.

V3 THEME: Accountability Without Audience

V3 answers one question only:

“Can I let one or two people see this without turning it into performance?”

1. Feature Flag

Enable:

FEATURE_TRUSTED_HANDS_V3 = true


All later phases remain disabled.

2. Trusted Hands — Data Model
TrustedContact
{
  id: string
  displayName: string
  contactMethod: string // email or identifier
  createdAt: string
}

SharedEntry
{
  id: string
  entryId: string
  trustedContactId: string
  reason: string
  createdAt: string
}

TrustedNote (One-Way Only)
{
  id: string
  sharedEntryId: string
  createdAt: string
  text: string
}


Rules:

Notes are private to the author of the entry

The trusted contact never sees their own note reflected

No back-and-forth

3. Trusted Hands UI
Trusted Hands Management Screen

User may add up to 3 trusted contacts

Clear copy:

“These are people you trust to witness work, not respond to it.”

No search.
No suggestions.
Manual entry only.

Sharing an Entry (Intentional Friction)

From entry detail:

User selects Share with Trusted Hand

Must:

Choose one trusted contact

Enter a reason for sharing

Short text, required

Copy example:

“Why are you sharing this?”

No defaults.

Trusted Notes (Witnessing)

Trusted contact can add one note

Note length limited

No editing after submission

No reply from the author

Author sees note privately

This is witnessing, not discussion.

4. UX Guardrails (Critical)

No notifications when a note is added
(user sees it next time they open the app)

No badges or indicators

No inbox metaphor

No urgency language

Trusted Hands should feel slightly inconvenient.
That’s intentional.

5. Export & Privacy

Export must include:

Which entries were shared

With whom

Notes received

Sharing never overrides local ownership

User can revoke a trusted contact at any time

Past shares remain in archive but no longer accessible

6. Explicit Non-Goals (Do NOT Build)

Mutual sharing

Conversations

Threaded notes

Group sharing

Notifications

Read receipts

Activity indicators

If it feels social, it’s wrong.

QA Checklist (Must Pass)

Sharing requires deliberate action

Only one trusted contact per share

Trusted contact can only add one note

No one can respond

No new notifications

No UI elements encourage sharing

App remains fully usable without Trusted Hands

Final Instruction

Trusted Hands is not a community feature.
It is deliberate exposure to accountability.

2. App Store Update Language — V3

This is review-safe, non-medical, non-productivity framing.

Version Title

Version 1.3 — Trusted Hands

What’s New

Trusted Hands lets you intentionally share a single entry with one person you trust — not for feedback, discussion, or validation, but simply to be witnessed.

There are no feeds, replies, or notifications.
Sharing is optional and deliberate.

The Hand remains private, local-first, and free of scores or engagement mechanics.

App Description (Addendum Paragraph)

The Hand is a private record of what you build, who you help, and what you learn.
Trusted Hands adds optional accountability without turning reflection into performance.
