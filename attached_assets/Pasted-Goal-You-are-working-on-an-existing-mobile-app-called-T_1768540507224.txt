Goal

You are working on an existing mobile app called The Hand. The app already implements V0 (entries, types, timestamps, edit window, addenda, local-first basics). Do not redesign the UI or rewrite architecture unless necessary. Implement a V1 upgrade and add scaffolding (feature flags + routes/components + data model extension points) for V2–V5, but keep only V1 enabled.

Non-Negotiable Product Constraints

Private by default

Local-first

No scores, streaks, badges, achievements

No public feed

No notifications (except system-critical)

No “insights”, no AI interpretation, no coaching

No behavioral nudges (“keep going”, “you should…”)

No social features beyond intentional entry sharing to a specific person/group (only optional, minimal, and can be stubbed)

If any existing code violates these, fix it.

Phase Plan (Implement V1, Scaffold V2–V5)
1) Add Feature Flags (Must)

Create a simple feature flag system (local config) so future roadmap phases can be toggled without refactors.

Flags:

FEATURE_PATTERNS_V1 = true

FEATURE_THEMES_V1 = true

FEATURE_REVIEW_MODE_V1 = true

FEATURE_EXPORT_V1 = true

FEATURE_RESPONSIBILITY_THREADS_V2 = false

FEATURE_TRUSTED_HANDS_V3 = false

FEATURE_MOMENTS_OF_POWER_V4 = false

FEATURE_ARCHIVE_MODE_V5 = false

Implementation can be:

a constant file features.ts

or a small config module in your stack

2) Data Model Changes (Minimal, Backward-Compatible)

Extend the entry model without breaking existing stored data.

Entry fields (new)

themes?: string[] (optional, user-defined tags/labels; no system suggestions)

addenda?: { id, createdAt, text }[] (if not already)

updatedAt?: string (if not already)

Additional tables/collections (scaffold only)

responsibilityThreads (V2, disabled): { id, title, createdAt }

entryThreadLinks (V2, disabled): { entryId, threadId }

trustedContacts (V3, disabled): { id, displayName, contactMethod }

Do not build UI for disabled features; just create types and placeholder storage hooks.

3) V1 Feature: Patterns View (Distribution Only)

Add a new screen called Patterns.

Requirements

User must navigate explicitly (no auto prompts).

Show a simple visualization of entry distribution over time:

weekly or monthly grouping is fine

show counts by type (Built / Helped / Learned)

No labels like “improving”, “declining”, “better”, “worse”

No recommendations

UI should be calm and minimal.

If charts are hard in the chosen mobile stack

Use a very simple representation:

grouped bars with basic components

or a table with counts per month/week

4) V1 Feature: Themes (User-Defined Only)

Add an optional theme/tag editor to entry detail.

Requirements

Themes are free-text labels

No auto-complete suggestions from the system (except showing the user’s own previously used themes)

Let users:

add theme

remove theme

Don’t encourage over-tagging

Add a “Themes” section in entry detail and entry edit.

5) V1 Feature: Quiet Review Mode (Manual)

Add a screen called Review:

User selects a time window: 30 / 60 / 90 days

Show entries in that range (read-only list is fine)

At the end show one optional prompt textbox:

“Is there anything here you’d want to do differently going forward?”

Save that reflection as a reviewNote entity (local-only):

{ id, rangeDays, createdAt, text }

No reminders, no scheduling, no streaks.

6) V1 Feature: Export (Artifact)

Add an Export screen with:

Export entries as:

plain text

JSON

Optional: basic PDF if easy; otherwise scaffold PDF export for later.

Export copy must be neutral:

“This is a record. It is not a report card.”

UX & Copy Rules (Important)

Neutral tone.

Never praise the user.

Never push daily usage.

No “Congrats” messages.

Empty states should be calm, e.g.:

“No entries yet.”

“When you build, help, or learn something that matters, you can record it here.”

Engineering Requirements

Keep local-first storage. If cloud sync exists, it must be off by default and must be end-to-end encrypted.

Ensure migrations for stored data are safe.

Add unit tests for:

entry serialization/deserialization with new fields

pattern aggregation logic

review filtering logic

Add simple analytics? No. Do not add tracking.

Deliverables

V1 screens: Patterns, Review, Export

Theme tagging in entry detail

Feature flag scaffolding for V2–V5

Data model updates + migration

Minimal tests + basic QA checklist

Don’t Break What Exists

Do not rewrite navigation unless required.

Do not change core UX flows drastically.

Keep the current design language.

Make small, reversible changes.

QA Checklist (Run Before Shipping)

App works fully offline

No push notifications

No leaderboard / streak / score anywhere

Patterns view shows distributions only

Themes are user-defined only

Review mode is manual only

Export works and produces correct data

Data migration doesn’t lose existing entries
